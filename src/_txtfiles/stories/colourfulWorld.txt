This is Billy and Splodge. Billy and Splodge are in a spaceship.
/
They are looking for animals in space.
/
/
Splodge sees a planet.
/
/
‘Everything on this planet is red. Look at this forest. The trees are red and the leaves are red. But there aren’t any animals here.’
/
/
Splodge sees another planet.
/
/
‘Everything on this planet is yellow. Look at the yellow sky and the yellow clouds. There is a yellow volcano too.
/
Look at the yellow smoke! There aren’t any animals here.’
/
/
Now Splodge sees another planet.
/
/
‘Everything on this planet is pink. Look at the pink sea. There are pink shells and pink plants in the sea.
/
There aren’t any animals here.’
/
/
Splodge sees another planet.
/
/
‘Everything on this planet is blue. This planet is very hot. There is a big blue sun and a
/
desert with blue sand. And look! There are blue plants. There aren’t any animals here.’
/
/
Splodge sees one more planet.
/
‘Everything on this planet is green. This planet is very cold.
/
The clouds are green and the snow is green. There aren’t any anim... Arghhh!’
/
/
Billy is in the spaceship. ‘Splodge, there are animals in space. Let’s go home!’
/
/
Splodge sees another planet. It’s planet Earth. The sky is blue and the sun is yellow.
/
The grass is green and the flowers are red and pink. What colours can you see?
